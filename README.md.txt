## Overview
This project implements a neural network model to predict university admission chances based on applicant data. The dataset used is `Admission.csv`, which contains various features like GRE scores, GPA, and other admission-related factors.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing with logging and error handling.
- Conversion of admission chances into a categorical variable.
- Neural network training (to be implemented).
- Performance evaluation and visualization.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Project
1. Ensure `Admission.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to load and preprocess the data.
3. Proceed with model training and evaluation (if implemented).

## Logging and Error Handling
- The script logs key steps, including data loading and preprocessing.
- Errors such as missing files or incorrect data formats are handled with meaningful log messages.
